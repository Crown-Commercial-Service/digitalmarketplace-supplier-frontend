    Dear supplier,
    <br/><br/>
    You, or one of your team, started an application to become a G-Cloud&nbsp;10 supplier.
    All contributors on your Digital Marketplace account will now receive email updates.
    The deadline for completing your application is 5pm BST on Wednesday 23 May 2018.
    <br/><br/>
    You must ask any clarification questions you have through your Digital Marketplace account before

    <br/><br/>
    To complete your application, you must:
    <ul>
      <li>complete your company details</li>
      <li>make the supplier declaration</li>
      <li>provide information about the services you offer, and mark each service as complete</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
    To understand if your services are suitable for G-Cloud&nbsp;10, read this guidance:
    <br/>
