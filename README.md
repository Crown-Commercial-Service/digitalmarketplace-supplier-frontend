# Digital Marketplace supplier frontend

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-supplier-frontend/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-supplier-frontend?branch=master)
[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-supplier-frontend/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-supplier-frontend/requirements/?branch=master)

Frontend supplier application for the digital marketplace.

- Python app, based on the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

## Setup

Install [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

```
sudo easy_install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment
 
 ```
 virtualenv ./venv
 ```

Set the required environment variables (for dev use local API instance if you 
have it running):
```
export DM_DATA_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
export DM_DATA_API_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth_token>
```

### Activate the virtual environment

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Upgrade dependencies

Install new Python dependencies with pip

```pip install -r requirements_for_test.txt```


## Front-end

Front-end code (both development and production) is compiled using [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

### Requirements

You need Node (minimum version of 0.10.0, maximum version 0.12.x) which will also get you [NPM](npmjs.org), Node's package management tool.

To check the version you're running, type:

```
node --version
```

### Installation

To install the required Node modules, type:

```
npm install
```

## Frontend tasks

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) is used for all frontend build tasks. The commands available are:

- `npm run frontend-build:development` (compile the frontend files for development)
- `npm run frontend-build:production` (compile the frontend files for production)
- `npm run frontend-build:watch` (watch all frontend files & rebuild when anything changes) FAILED
- `npm run frontend-install` (install all non-NPM dependancies)

Note: `npm run frontend-install` is run automatically as a post-install task when you run `npm install`.





### Run the tests

To run the whole testsuite:

```
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

To just run the JavaScript tests:

```
npm test
```

### Run the server

To run the Supplier Frontend App for local development you can use the convenient run
script, which sets the required environment variables to defaults if they have
not already been set:

```
./scripts/run_app.sh
```

The script is a wrapper around `python application.py runserver` so all the options available there
can also be sent in. For example, to set the host:

```
./scripts/run_app.sh -h '0.0.0.0'
```

More generally, the command to start the server is:

```
python application.py runserver
```

The supplier frontend runs on port 5003. Use the app at [http://127.0.0.1:5003/suppliers](http://127.0.0.1:5003/suppliers)

### Using FeatureFlags

To use feature flags, check out the documentation in (the README of)
[digitalmarketplace-utils](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-utils#using-featureflags).

### Configuring boto

[boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) provides a Python interface to Amazon Web Services; it's what we're using to download from and upload to our s3 buckets.

If you don't [configure your AWS credentials correctly](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html?highlight=~/.aws/credentials#credentials)
on your local machine, you'll probably run into a nasty-looking `boto.exception.NoAuthHandlerFound` page at some point.

The short version is that you should create an `~/.aws/credentials` file formatted like so:
```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ...
aws_secret_access_key = ...
```

AWS access keys can be found/configured in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) section of the
[digitalmarketplace-development AWS console](https://digitalmarketplace-development.signin.aws.amazon.com/console).


#### Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing problems connecting, make sure to `unset` any `env` variables used by boto (e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
`AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` and `AWS_PROFILE`) as they may be overriding the values in your credentials file.

### Running on Heroku

- Setup the heroku command https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up
- Create the app with `heroku create`
- Set the app to have a multi-buildpack with `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git`
- Set environment variables with `heroku config:set`
- Deploy the app with `git push heroku <your-branch>:master`
